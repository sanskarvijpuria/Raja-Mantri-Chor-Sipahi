# Raja-Mantri-Chor-Sipahi
Little beginners project

Yes, you read it right. This project is about the game we Indian used to play when we were a kid.

This is currently Command line but in future, I will make it a web app.
This program asks for the four players names and then randomly assign the roles. And then it will ask for the Who is the thief?(chor).
It maintains the scores and updates it over every turn. You can also restart and your score will get initialised to zero.
I have tried to make it as simple and documented as I can.


If you have any suggestions to make this project better, then feel free to contact me. Ciao
