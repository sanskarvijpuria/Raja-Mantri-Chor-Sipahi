#  Raja mantri chor sipahi game
#  Python 3
#This is a multiplayer game which first asks for the player name and then randomly assigns any role.
#Now the Mantri who is you or any other person sitting next to you have to type the correct name.
#This is like a very beginners version. 
#I may improve it over time and maybe in future, you can play this on your phone with friends. 
#Ciao


#Import the random library to randomly assign roles and time library to use the function sleep.
#The program can run without time and sleep(). I used it for little suspense, thrill and just to slow it a little bit.
import random
